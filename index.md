Soon to be Graduate software engineer. Previously, I have worked on real time classification of sensor data; engineering the infrastructure, the ML and the algorithms behind it and now I am working in a Big Data startup in Cologne. My responsibilities here are mostly affiliated with coding infrastructural and architectural changes and containerizing functionality. Right before I came here I worked intensively for a couple of months on a paper that resulted from the experiments conducted for my graduate thesis, related to Social Network Analysis and Opinion Mining. In the past I also participated in a publication that resulted from winning ACM's DEBS Grand challenge in 2015.

Right now I am interested in mastering cloud and big scale technologies. I consider myself an engineer that is really interested in Data Science. I care deeply about good use of programming principles and want to be on the forefront observing every paradigm shift. 

## Education

`2010 - present`

__Computer Engineering and Informatics Department, University of Patras__

- M.Sc. (1 course left) Expected graduation: Feb 2017, Expected Grade: 7.24/10

__Thesis Topic:__ _Marketing Campaing Targeting Using Bridge Extraction_ 

- accepted as full [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7gpm0rYX21kS09lQThfMkZtQjA/view?usp=sharing) by ACM's Symposium on Applied Computing, awaits publication in April

__Academic Interests:__ Algorithmic Engineering, Machine Learning, Databases, Time Series Analysis, Data Mining, Social Network Analysis


## Publications

__Pimp my taxi ride__ (DEBS '15 Proceedings of the 9th ACM International Conference on Distributed Event-Based System / ACM New York, NY, USA Â©2015)
As part of a 4 member team, our submission achieved the best score among 17 university teams. The solution required very precise manipulation of complex Data Structures and good understanding of Dynamic Programming principles.

## Experience

`Sept 2016 - present`
__Software Engineer__ at [fedger.io](http://fedger.io/)

In fedger.io I am responsible for designing and implementing new modules to run on our cloud infrastructure as well as improving old ones and taking care of their deployment and continuous integration. We mostly use Python3.5 and shell scripting and deploy everything in Docker containers that get orchestrated by Rancher. For the CI we use Drone and most of our cloud functionalities are handled with use of aws S3 and SQS.

`Oct 2015 - Apr 2016`
__Machine Learning Engineer__ intern at [Factor-E Analytics](http://www.factor-e.eu)

In Factor-E Analytics I mainly designed and built the company's backend infrastructure for real time classification
of sensor data and implemented state of the art timeseries analysis algorithms. I consider my contribution
important judging by the fact that the functionalities I implemented play central role to the company's
operations today.


## Assets / Technical skills
My strongest programming asset right now is __Python__. I have heavily utilized most of the popular scientific 
programming libraries and tools (__Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, IPython, Cython__) for pretty much everything
the past two years. I am really comfortable with __shell scripting__ and have excessively used __C++__ as a student. I have
worked with some mainstream SQL and NoSQL DBs (__MySQL, PostgreSQL, S3, Azure Table, ArangoDB, MongoDB, Redis__) and recently
I started using containerization (__Docker__). In terms of Machine Learning I have experimented with most of the popular algorithms
and techniques (e.g. __SVMs, XGBoost, AdaBoost, RandomForests, Logistic Regression, Generalized Lasso,
 Naive Bayes, Ensembling and Stacking methods__) and have used some in production . I also had the chance to experiment with some Deep Learning frameworks like __Torch__ (trained an RNN on Shakespeare's literature) and Facebook's __Fasttext__ (extension of word2vec) for text Analysis.
