## Currently

`October 2015 - now`

- __Backend Developer, Data Analyst__ intern in [Factor-E Analytics](http://www.factor-e.eu)

As part of the team, I have been dealing a lot with building RESTful api endpoints
for the central module of the company's cloudbased infrastructure in Django Rest Framework, modifying
and managing database schemas according to desing constraints that pop up and further
utilizing DRF's functionallity for creating advanced filters and specific queries.
I have also been building data manipulation and data visualization tools for the team
and have taken a close look to many real-time time series classification techniques that
fit for highly robust and scalable solutions. I also had the chance decide upon available
NoSQL systems and set up parts of the company's infrastructure.
