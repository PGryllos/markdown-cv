Soon to be Graduate software engineer. Previously, I have worked on real time classification of sensor data; engineering the infrastructure, the ML and the algorithms behind it and now I am working in a Big Data startup in Cologne. My responsibilities here are mostly affiliated with coding infrastructural and architectural changes and containerizing functionality. Right before I came here I worked intensively for a couple of months on a paper that resulted from the experiments conducted for my graduate thesis, related to Social Network Analysis and Opinion Mining. In the past I also participated in a publication that resulted from winning ACM's DEBS Grand challenge in 2015.

Right now I am interested in mastering cloud and big scale technologies. I care deeply about good use of programming principles and want to be on the forefront observing every paradigm shift. 

## Education

`2010 - present`

__Computer Engineering and Informatics Department, University of Patras__

- M.Sc. (1 course left) Expected graduation: Feb 2017, Expected Grade: 7.24/10

__thesis topic:__ _Marketing Campaing Targeting Using Bridge Extraction_ 

- accepted as full [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7gpm0rYX21kS09lQThfMkZtQjA/view?usp=sharing) by ACM's Symposium on Applied Computing, waits publication in April

__academic interests:__ Algorithmic Engineering, Machine Learning, Databases, Time Series Analysis, Data Mining, Social Network Analysis


## Publications

__Pimp my taxi ride__ (DEBS '15 Proceedings of the 9th ACM International Conference on Distributed Event-Based System / ACM New York, NY, USA Â©2015)
As part of a 4 member team, our submission achieved the best score among 17 university teams.
[__publication__](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2675743.2776759)


## Experience

`Sept 2016 - present`
__Software Engineer__ at [fedger.io](http://fedger.io/).
Other than working on day to day Data Engineering, ETL and programming tasks I have also been involved with text analysis using neural nets. 

`Oct 2015 - Apr 2016`
__Machine Learning Engineer__ intern at [Factor-E Analytics](http://www.factor-e.eu)

In Factor-E Analytics I mainly designed and built the company's backend infrastructure for real time classification
of sensor data and implemented state of the art timeseries analysis algorithms. I consider my contribution
important judging by the fact that the functionalities I implemented play central role to the company's
operations today.


## assets / technical skills
My strongest programming asset right now is __Python__. I have heavily utilized most of the popular scientific 
programming libraries and tools (__Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, IPython, Cython__) for pretty much everything
the past two years. I am really comfortable with __shell scripting__ and have excessively used __C++__ as a student. I have
worked with some mainstream SQL and NoSQL DBs (__MySQL, PostgreSQL, S3, Azure Table, ArangoDB, MongoDB, Redis__) and recently
I started using containerization (__Docker__). In term of Machine Learning I have experimented with most of the popular algorithms
and techniques and used some in production (e.g. __SVMs, XGBoost, AdaBoost, RandomForests, Logistic Regression, Generalized Lasso,
 Naive Bayes, Ensembling and Stacking methods__). I also had the chance to experiment with some Deep Learning frameworks like __Torch__ (trained an RNN on Shakespeare's literature) and Facebook's __Fasttext__ (extension of word2vec) for text Analysis.
